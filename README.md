# Luca Palonca Master's Thesis
The aim of this work is to analyse social media content trough topic models and study the difference of the sentiment between 2015 and 2018. We chose this timespan because during this period two opposite political forces have ruled in Italy. 
Moreover, we attempt to build a hate map based on georeferenced tweets.
